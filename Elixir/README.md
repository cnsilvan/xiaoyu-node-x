# Elixir Testnet Validator Deployment Guide  


Elixir is a modular DPoS network designed to provide liquidity for order book exchanges, with native integration. Its cross-chain and composability enables decentralized exchanges to integrate the Elixir protocol into their core infrastructure, unlocking retail liquidity. Elixir has native integrations with more than 30 leading DEXs. In addition, Elixir launched the fully collateralized, yield-generating synthetic dollar deUSD, which aims to be the collateral of choice for order book liquidity between decentralized and centralized exchanges.
